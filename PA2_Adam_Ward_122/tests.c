	so im not really sure how you want us to do this, I had a few ideas
	first off, i thought i could do the various functions requiring scanf
	and user inputs to instead be seperate, reading the user inputs into a seperate .csv file,
	and letting the insert function read from that, instead of directly asking for user input.
	doing such would then allow me to make THIS function simply put those entries into the .csv file,
	and then run the insert function with the given .csv. however that would have been weird to implement,
	and could fuck with what ive currenly got actually working. If the purpose of this is to TEST my
	functions with various values, I instead figured the best way that also wouldnt fuck with my actual 
	program was to simply copy paste the entire insert function here, and just not ask for user
	values and instead give it my own. That fulfills the condition of not having args or return values,
	and I think works perfectly fine. Anywho, back to it! <3
